Let it rain


## Description ##

Apply a rain effect to your images using WebGL.

### How to use ###
* Install and go to 'Appearance' -> 'Customize'
* Open Section for Header or Footer Images and enable/disable the Rain Effect.
* Or/And open Section for Rain Effect and chose when to load rain effect script.
* When the script is loaded, the effect will be applied for all images with class 'rain-effect'.
* Only for images in the media library. Doesn't work for remote Images (because we'll make an ajax request to get the thumbnail image source).
* Please note that the effect is highly experimental and might not work as expected in all browsers.


### Thanks for beautiful ressoucres
* The effect is based on [Lucas Bebbers](http://gardenestudio.com.br/) script on [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/11/04/rain-water-effect-experiments/). Find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/codrops/RainEffect).
