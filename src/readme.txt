== Description ==

Apply a rain effect to your images using WebGL.

= How to use =
* Install and go to 'Appearance' -> 'Customize'
* Open Section for Header or Footer Images and enable/disable the Rain Effect.
* Or/And open Section for Rain Effect and chose when to load rain effect script.
* When the script is loaded, the effect will be applied for all images with class 'rain-effect'.
* Only for images in the media library. Doesn't work for remote Images (because we'll make an ajax request to get the thumbnail image source).
* Please note that the effect is highly experimental and might not work as expected in all browsers.


= Thanks for beautiful ressoucres
